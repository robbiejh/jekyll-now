## The Exam ##
This week we had our first exam for this class. Honestly, I thought the exam was pretty close to the material that we went over in class, so I would have to say it was fair. I think I could have studied harder for it, but now I know what to expect on the next one. 

## What did I do this past week? ##
This past week I pretty much died from all the exams and projects I had due, but somehow I'm still here! Now that all of that is out of the way, I can pretty much breathe for like an entire month until I have to do it all over again. In class, we basically went over the "const" keyword and how to use it in various scenarios with pointers, data types, and a mixture of the two. It was really just confusing more than anything.

## What's in my way? ##
I still need to do the readings for this week, but everything is pretty chill other than that. I need to keep applying for jobs more than anything, really.

## What will I do next week? ##
Apply for jobs and start on this next project.

## My Experience (Thus Far) ##
My experience has been okay so far. The class is pretty intense and the exams for it are no different. Some of the things we learn are cool and seem useful; others have me asking myself: "am I ever going to encounter this in the field post-grad?".

## Tip-Of-The-Week ##
My tip for this week is to know the importance of maintaining a healthy daily exercise regimen. I cannot tell you how insane I would have went this past week from all the stuff I had to do if I did not take an hour from studying everyday to go to the gym. For me, I love weight training, but even if that's not your thing, just get on a treadmill and run for like 30 minutes or something. I gurantee it will help your stressful week go by a lot better.
