## What did I do this past week? ##
I cannot think of a single person who actually believes that the first week of school is _not_ hectic. Between scrambling to gather the necessary textbooks and school supplies, along with attempting (and often failing) to get into the necessary computer science courses so that you may someday graduate, I have to say that I am not a fan. However, I feel as though I had a smooth transition into the semester this week. I got all my textbooks super cheap and into my electives of choice from their respective waitlists-- Object Oriented Programming and Information Retrieval and Web Search. I really like all of my professors so far, and I have already learned a great deal in Object Oriented Programming about C++ and how it differs from Java.

## What's in my way? ##
I believe the only thing in my way of success for this semester is the summer mindset that I am still in. I need to gain back my focus and determination in order to graduate this coming May, all while maintaining my strong grade point average. Attaining a decent sleep schedule would also be very beneficial. Aside from all of that, I really need to setup all the necessary development tools on my machine for this course, start on the readings for this coming week, and prepare myself mentally for the storm that is CS 331 this semester.
