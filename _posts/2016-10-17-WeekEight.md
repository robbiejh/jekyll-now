title: Week Eight

## What did I do this past week? ##
This past week was much more laid back than the previous weeks. Since all my tests fell on the same week/same day, this past week was much like the calm after the storm. In OOP this week, we learned more about allocators and how they are implemented so that we can do it in our project 3. We also learned about arrays in C++, how constructors play a role in array initialization, and using the stack vs the heap. Our project 3 was also assigned this past week, and it seems like a more interesting one than the previous. 

## What's in my way? ##
The only thing that's in my way is this next project. My partner Jamie and I have made really good progress on it so far, and I am happy with our efforts. All we really lack at this point is our deallocation algorithm and writing the unit tests for our code. Outside of this class, I also have an exam in my Info Retrieval class that shouldn't be too bad.

## What will I do next week? ##
Mainly finish this project and study for my exam in my other class.

## My Experience (Thus Far) ##
So far I have found the material for this class to be pretty interesting, and I really enjoy this current project a lot more than the first two because of its more practical use.

## Tip-Of-The-Week ##
Preparing for technical interviews? My advice would be to use resources such as hackerrank.com and Mike Scotts CS314 slides when preparing. I guarantee that 95% of all your (technical) interview questions will be based around data structures, and hackerrank.com problems are a good way to practice/refresh those concepts for yourself.
