## What did I do this past week? ##
This past week was probably the most stressful week I think that I have had in a while. I had the career fair on Tuesday, as well as two programming projects due on the same day on Thursday (which has never happened to me before in college, oddly enough). One of the projects I had to do was for this class -- the Netflix project. My partner Coty and I finished our Netflix rating prediction program based off of the algorithm that was explained in the article Downing provided us. It was relatively straightforward; however, we chose to use serialized caches (Boost) in our implementation, and that definitely took a lot of time to get right. However, once we got it all working, using the caches was super easy and fast. Our completed program produced ratings that had a root mean squared error of 0.97. 

## What's in my way? ##
The only thing in my way for this class seems to be the upcoming exam. I feel like the material has been getting a little more thorough lately, so  I definitely need to go back over a lot of it and start studying more.

## What will I do next week? ##
This coming week will also be spent trying to get all of the things I have due completed. The week after next I have two exams and a project all due on the same day (cue smiley emoji with a gun next to his head), which is really quite annoying and completely unnecessary. I also need to continue searching and applying for full-time jobs this week, so I really have quite a lot to do, but I should be able to do it all if I just stay focused. 

## My Experience (Thus Far) ##
I'm really confused as to why the CS department titled this course "Object Oriented Programming" when all I'm really spending my time doing is trying to get Travis CI/my .travis.yml to work. That statement pretty much sums up my experience so far.

## Tip-Of-The-Week ##
I don't know about you, but I hate working in the CS lab. There's never any open computers because of Norman's 439, there's always some loud kid with his Beats around his neck yelling about some new mod for League or whatever, and most importantly -- you have to leave the comfort of your own room. That's why you need the Sublime SFTP package, because everyone uses Sublime right? Well it is found here: https://wbond.net/sublime_packages/sftp and basically its a neat little tool that adds built in SFTP functionality to Sublime so you can open/edit/save files on your CS account over SFTP using Sublime's nice GUI interface (having the GUI folder view of all your files is very handy when working on large projects like Pintos). I find that it definitely speeds up productivity whenever I'm trying to do my work over SSH.
