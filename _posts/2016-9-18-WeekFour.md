## What did I do this past week? ##
This past week I was actually absent from class on Monday because I was feeling pretty sick. This also happened to be the day that our second project "Netflix" was assigned to us and discussed in class (what a day to miss!). For this project, we have to try and solve the Netflix prize by predicting the ratings that a customer would give using some training data given to us that is based off of their past ratings. We must devise an algorithm to solve this problem, all while making sure that our predicted ratings yield a root mean squared error of < 1.0. Other than the project, we also had a guest speaker from Bloomberg come to class and talk to us a little bit about what a day in the life of a developer is like, as well as about some of the tools that he uses in his day-to-day work. 

## What's in my way? ##
The only two things in my way so far is this project and my other project for my informationr retrieval class. So far, my partner Coty and I have gotten all the necessary development tools set up for this project, while also getting a head start on the actual coding. 

## What will I do next week? ##
This coming week is the College of Natural Sciences career fair, which never fails to fall on a very stressful week of school work. My goal in going to the career fair is to try and scope out some potential employers for a full time position post-graduation this coming May. Aside from that, I will also be working on/finishing up this Netflix project for this course. It seems like my partner and I have gotten the basic functionality of our code working; however, we still need to improve our prediction algorithm and utilize Boost Serialization.

## My Experience (Thus Far) ##
I feel like this class is intense between the readings, projects, quizzes, and the coming exams. This project definitely seems to have kicked up the intensity of the course up a notch from the last project Collatz. I think I was able to complete that one in like a matter of only 2 days; however, this Netflix project is definitely taking a lot longer to pull through. 

## Tip-Of-The-Week ##
In the spirit of the College of Natural Science career fair that is coming this week, my advice would be to GO to the career fairs offered here and take full advantage of them. While you can apply anywhere online these days, it certainly does make a huge difference to make a face to face connection with someone from the company itself. Even if you've never heard of a certain company before, just go up and talk to them anyway and be honest that you know nothing about them. Recruiters love to tell unfamiliar people all about what their company does. I did that once with athenahealth and sure enough, I got an interview with them because the recruiter loved me (obviously).
